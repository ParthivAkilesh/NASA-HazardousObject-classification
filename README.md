# NASA - Hazardous Object Classification
   This repository contains an End-to-End model for NASA-Nearest Earth Objects dataset where an machine learning model is designed and trained to classify the ojects, which are close to earth.
   After identifying the closest objects, the ML model tries to classify whether the objects are hazardous to earth or not. This is done by getting some parameters which includes the velocity of the object toward earth
   and the distances.
